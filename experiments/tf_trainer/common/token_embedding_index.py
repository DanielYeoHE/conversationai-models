  We have two levels of indirection (e.g. word to idx and then idx to
  embedding) which could reduce embedding size if multiple words map to the
  same idx. This is not currently a use case.

  Args:
    embeddings_path: Local, GCS, or HDFS path to embedding file. Each line
      should be a word and its vector representation separated by a space.

  Returns:
    Tuple of:
      A vocabulary dictionary (mapping words to their index)
      A Numpy array of word embeddings with shape (vocab size, embedding size),
      A unique unknown token index (greater than all other token indexes)
